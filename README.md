# DigitPerceptron
Interactive Digit Recognition

This is created with Visual Studio 2019 using VC++.

It uses multiple 64bit external libraries. All necessary library files are included under the subfolder (lib).
- Eigen 3.3.7 (for matrix computation)
- freeglut 3.2.1 (for OpenGL rendering)
- ALGLIB 3.10.0  (for SVD computation)
- FTGL & FreeType (for text rendering on GL space)

With the designed tool, the following paper has been published. 
- Dong H. Jeong, Jin-Hee Cho, Feng Chen, Audun Josang, Soo-Yeon Ji, Active Learning on Neural Networks through Interactive Generation of Digit Patterns and Visual Representation, 13th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, 2023
